</header>
<p><strong>Weight:</strong> 30%</p>
<p><strong>Deadline:</strong> Tue 12 Nov 09:00</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Assignment demonstrating understanding
of principles and approaches to automation</p>
<h1 id="scenario">Scenario</h1>
<p>You are to deploy a system of your choice using Ansible. There must
be at least the control server and 3 other hosts (the configuration on
which may be very similar!)</p>
<p>Ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic local provisioning (users, groups) etc.</li>
<li>Attempt .MSI installation files on Windows</li>
<li>IRC client and server</li>
<li>Samba / SMB (client, server, drive mapping)</li>
<li>NFS setup (client and server)</li>
<li>Web server</li>
<li>Desktop (xfce, xrdp)</li>
</ul>
<p>Machines may be Windows and/or Linux.</p>
<h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>
<p>It is expected that submitted files will be free of syntax and basic
formatting errors, such that they will run, even if the actions they
take are incorrect. Submitted files that contain errors that prevent
them running (e.g.Â syntax errors) will be treated as not submitted and
will receive zero.</p>
<h2 id="vm-setup-15">VM setup (15%)</h2>
<p>VMs for this exercise may be set up in the XOA system in DkIT or on
resource of your own.</p>
<p>The VMs must remain set up until you are told that they can be
deleted.</p>
<p>Modify the Linux VM configuration such that <code>sudo</code> does
<em>not</em> require a password.</p>
<h2 id="automation-ssh-key-setup-15">Automation SSH key setup (15%)</h2>
<p>On the control host set up an ssh keypair and transfer the public key
to the managed hosts such that <code>administrator</code> (or similar
account) can log into all hosts without a password.</p>
<h2 id="ansible-inventory-10">Ansible inventory (10%)</h2>
<p>On the control host, create your inventory file for the 3 managed
hosts. The inventory file should be submitted as
<code>inventory.ini</code>.</p>
<h2 id="ansible-playbook-40">Ansible playbook (40%)</h2>
<p>Your ansible playbook in <code>setup_playbook.yml</code> should
implement as much of the desired functionality as possible.</p>
<p>You should develop this iteratively, bearing in mind that a
well-designed playbook will be idempotent.</p>
<h2 id="non-automatable-10">Non-automatable (10%)</h2>
<p>Items that you could not automate should be listed in a file named
<code>non_automatable.txt</code>. Each should have a reason why.</p>
<h2 id="instructions-10">Instructions (10%)</h2>
<p>Write a brief set of instructions named <code>instructions.txt</code>
that incorporate running the playbook(s), and describe how
non-automatable steps should be performed.</p>
<p>You should briefly include instructions for testing.</p>
<h1 id="submission">Submission</h1>
<p>Submissions will be collected automatically after the submission
date. Assuming that you have:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Set up the GitLab <code>automation_labs</code> folder.</li>
<li>Created a subfolder called <code>ca1</code>.</li>
<li>Supplied all files required from the instructions above.</li>
<li>Committed and pushed your CA1 work before the deadline.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can deem it submitted. If you wish you can check with me in
class.</p>
<h1 id="demonstration">Demonstration</h1>
<p>Verification demonstration will be required during lab time. No
presentation will be required. Students who do not attend for
demonstration will receive zero.</p>
<h1 id="feedback">Feedback</h1>
<p>Summary feedback will be provided via Moodle and/or GitLab.</p>
<h1 id="qa">Q&amp;A</h1>
<p><em>Q&amp;A will go here.</em></p>
