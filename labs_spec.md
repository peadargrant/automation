# Automation labs

**Weight**: L8 = 40, HDip = 30

**Deadline**: End of module

**Note:**
- Weighting differs between L8 and HDip students.
- Some content and lab exercises are omitted from the one of the groups.
- Repository and submission requirements are identical.

## Introduction

You will maintain a git repository to chart your weekly lab work in this module.
This git repository will be held on the DkIT GitLab server at `gitlab.comp.dkit.ie`.


## Assessment

Marks will be awarded for completion of each topic's lab tasks.

Each topic's work will be in a numbered folder in your git repository. 
Files required for submission each week will be clearly identified.
You must follow the required structure exactly to receive marks.

Unless specified otherwise, all weeks are equally weighted.

You are required to commit and push ongoing progress.
In a reasonable professional context, it's expected that you may be up to 2 weeks, and catch up the subsequent week.
However, it is required that each week's work is pushed when completed.

Large amounts of work pushed in bulk will receive zero marks.


## Repository

Your repository must be called `automation_labs` and maintained on the DkIT GitLab server.

It must be *forked* from the starting repository provided by the lecturer.

The lecturer `grantp` must be granted developer access from week 1, which must remain in place for the remainder of the module.

*Repository setup will be done in the first lab in a guided fashion.*



## Academic integrity

A variety of tools will be used on an *ongoing* basis to monitor compliance with academic integrity requirements.
This will include comparisons against generative sources, internet content and cross-comparison among students in both modules.

Unless directly specified in the directions of a lab exercise or CA, it is not permitted to utilise generative AI or other similar tools.
